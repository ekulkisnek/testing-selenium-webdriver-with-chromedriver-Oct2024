Here's a basic example of how you can use Selenium with ChromeDriver in Replit. This example uses the `selenium` and `webdriver-manager` libraries to manage the ChromeDriver installation.

```python
# Import required libraries
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

# Set up Chrome options to run in headless mode
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")

# Set up ChromeDriver
service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=chrome_options)

# Navigate to the desired webpage
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Get the webpage source
print(driver.page_source)

# Close the Chrome driver
driver.quit()
```

However, please note that the above code may not work in Replit due to the limitations of the free plan. Replit's free plan does not support GUI applications and has limited resources.

If you're experiencing issues with the above code, you can try the following:

1. Upgrade to a paid Replit plan to get more resources and support for GUI applications.
2. Use a different library or framework that does not require a GUI application, such as `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping.
3. Use a cloud-based Selenium service that provides a REST API for interacting with the browser, such as Selenium Grid or Sauce Labs.

Additionally, you can try to use the following Replit-specific configuration:

```python
# Import required libraries
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

# Set up Chrome options to run in headless mode
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-gpu")

# Set up ChromeDriver
service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=chrome_options)

# Navigate to the desired webpage
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Get the webpage source
print(driver.page_source)

# Close the Chrome driver
driver.quit()
```

And also, make sure to add the following to your `replit.nix` file:

```
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [ chromium ];
}
```

This configuration tells Replit to install the Chromium browser and make it available to your application.
